While postdocing at [Dartmouth](http://ccnl.dartmouth.edu/), we set up a colab with a [UCLA experimentalist/biologist lab](https://izquierdolab.psych.ucla.edu/) to collect single-photon calcium imaging data from rats performing a decision-making and learning task. Calcium imaging was relatively new to this lab, so I was pulled in to set up a pipeline for the biologists to process their data. Mostly, I adapted codes from the [CaImAn toolbox](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn), customizing the pipeline for both offline and online video processing ([eLife article](https://elifesciences.org/articles/38173)).
